_Sentiment Analysis Using Python (NLP)_

*Gist of Project:*

Often we come across customerâ€™s in business when some of them are sometimes rude, sometimes, confused or happy. Yes! But how about according to the mood of the customer, according to their sentiments we can give them offer and talk to them accordingly. So this can be done using Natural Language Processing (NLP) by analysing their voice or by the comments they put on social media.

Here I have created a project which can recognize and analyse mood of users understand their sentiments on social media platform. For my project I chose Elon Musk as user and Twitter as social media platform. This project can give visualization about how the person tweets and graphically display the positivity or the negativity of tweets of the person.

*Future Scope:*
1.	This technology can be used to stop negative comments or information circulated on social platform. Thus creating a positive environment.
2.	This can be further developed using NLP techniques to recognise voice and thus understand emotions and sentiments of person. Accordingly talk to them.
3.	This technique can be used to create a chat-bot for customer to answer their basic queries that they face.
4.	This can be used in schools and colleges to understand the sentiments and emotions of students.
5.	 This can be used by implementing NLP to get right feedback to the market or business by analysing the voice and sentiments if customers are satisfied or not.
